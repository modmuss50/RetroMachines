Custom ROMs can be loaded by either clicking the "Open ROM" buttom, or dragging a ROM into the Minecraft window.

This mod includes a modified version of the open source [mvdnes/rboy](https://github.com/mvdnes/rboy) Gameboy Emulator, built to be embedded within a Minecaft mod.

This mod was created in a couple of days, and is currently only a prototype to prove the idea is possible, I have some more ideas for this mod in the future:

- Improved audio, including using the Minecraft audio system
- Link cable support between players on a server
- More included games
- Other consoles and retro hardware.
- Improved textures (let me know if you can help!)
